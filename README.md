# ⚽ Analysis of Players’ Goals and Performance

This project aims to collect and analyze the performance data of **Mohamed Salah** across various football matches over multiple seasons.

We used **web scraping** techniques to extract detailed player data such as:
- Minutes played  
- Match result  
- Expected goals (xG)  
- Assists and more.

The main goals of the project are:
- Clean and preprocess raw football data
- Analyze performance trends over time
- Visualize key metrics like goals vs xG, performance per season, etc.
- Deploy findings through an interactive **Streamlit** web app
